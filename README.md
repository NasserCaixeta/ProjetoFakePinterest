# ProjetoFakePinterest

## Description
This academic project is a web application similar to Pinterest, fully developed by me. The platform allows users to create and manage collections of images (pins), organized by categories or topics. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore, save, and share images, offering a personalized visual experience.

## Features
- User authentication (login and sign-up)
- Create, edit, and delete image collections (pins)
- Organize images into categories or boards
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Search and discover images based on user interests

## Technologies Used
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the front-end
- **JavaScript**: To manage interactivity and dynamic content
- **Backend Technology (e.g., Node.js, Python, or others)**: For user authentication and database interaction (adjust based on your project)
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)**: To store user data and collections
